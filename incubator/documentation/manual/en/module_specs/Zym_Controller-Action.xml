    <title>Using the Zym_Controller_Action_Abstract</title>

    <para>
        The <code>Zym_Controller_Action_Abstract</code> class is an extension of Zend_Controller_Action.
        It adds get methods for the view object and view prefix. It also provides a goto method to perform redirects.
    </para>
	
    <para>
        The goto method provides a proxy to the redirector action helper. It has basically the same interface as the redirector's goto method.
		The only difference is the added $exit boolean. This boolean decides if the script should exit immediately after the redirect is issued.
