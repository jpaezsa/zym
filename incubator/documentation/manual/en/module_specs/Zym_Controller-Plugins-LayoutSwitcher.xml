    <para>
        The <code>Zym_Controller_Plugin_LayoutSwitcher</code> package is a collection of two plugins that allow you to dynamically select a layout for Zend_Layout during the routing process.
        The first plugin, called <code>Zym_Controller_Plugin_LayoutSwitcher_Module</code>, selects the layout based on the requested module.
        The second plugin, called <code>Zym_Controller_Plugin_LayoutSwitcher_Router</code>, selects the layout based on the requested route.
        Both of these plugins fire at <code>preDispatch()</code>, so they work as expected when using the <code>_forward()</code> during the routing process to forward to a different module or route.
    </para>

    <para>
        Rules can be added to the plugins with the <code>addLayout()</code> method. This method takes two arguments: the layout name and the rule name.
        The rule name is either the name of the route or the name of the module (depending on which plugin you are configuring).
        If no matching rule is found during the routing process, it will default to Zend_Layout's layout configuration.
