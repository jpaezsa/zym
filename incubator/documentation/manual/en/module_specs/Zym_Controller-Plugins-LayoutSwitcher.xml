    <para>
        The <code>Zym_Controller_Plugin_LayoutSwitcher</code> provides two plugins that allow you to switch the active layout for Zend_Layout.
        The first plugin is the <code>Zym_Controller_Plugin_LayoutSwitcher_Module</code> plugin. As the name suggests it switches layouts based on the current active module.
        The second plugin is the <code>Zym_Controller_Plugin_LayoutSwitcher_Router</code> plugin. It allows you to switch layouts based on the currently active route.
    </para>

    <para>
        Before registering either one of these plugins to the front controller, you need to configure the plugin.
        This is done by instantiating the desired plugin and adding routes/modules to it with the addLayout() method.
        The addLayout() method takes two arguments: the layout name and the "rule" name. The rule is either the name of the route or the name of the module, depending on which plugin you are configuring.
        After adding the plugin to the front controller everything is set.
