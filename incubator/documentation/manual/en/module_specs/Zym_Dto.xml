    <title>Using Zym_Dto</title>

    <para>
        Zym_Dto is a very simple class to store model data in a generic way. It can be serialized like a normal array for data transport.
    </para>

    <para>
        The class implements <code>Zym_ArrayData_Interface</code>, <code>ArrayAccess</code>, <code>Iterator</code> and <code>Serializable</code> as interface.
        The ArrayAccess and Iterator implementations allow you to access and iterate over the object as if it is a normal array.
    </para>

    <para>
        Another way to access the DTO object data is through the getValue(), setValue(), hasValue() and removeValue() methods.
    </para>

    <para>
        The toArray() and setFromArray() methods that are required by the Zym_ArrayData_Interface do exactly what you would expect them to do.
        toArray() returns the data of the DTO in a plain PHP array. setFromArray() loads the data from a plain PHP array into the DTO.
    </para>

    <para>
        There are two ways to serialize the DTO. The first is by explicitly calling the serialize() method on the object.
        The second is to use PHP's serialize() function. Both methods will return a plain serialized array with the DTO's contents.
    </para>
