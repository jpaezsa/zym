            This adapter allows chaining of other authentication adapters to 
            authenticate a user from multiple sources. Using this adapter can
            allows authenticating users from sources such as database, LDAP, and a remote service
            all in one go.

        <para>
            Setting up the chain is simple because you just add adapters to the chain with 
            <code>addAdapter(Zend_Auth_Adapter_Interface)</code>. The result is returned from
            the first successful adapter. A result returned from a failed authentication
            attempt is created by the chain adapter itself with a <code>Zend_Auth_Result::FAILURE</code>
            code, null identity, and an array of error messages from all failed adapters. Because 
            it may be helpful to determine which adapter was successful for processing the user, the
            chain adapter provides the <code>getLastSuccessfulAdapter()</code> method which 
            returns the successful adapter instance.
