    <para>
        Zym does not have its own loader, rather you are to use <classname>Zend_Loader</classname>
        since it provides all the neccessary features needed.

        <para>
            Unobvious to many newcomers is the fact that <classname>Zend_Loader</classname>
            was not designed to load files as a replacement to <code>require_once()</code>
            in applications with code such as <code>Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Controller_Front');</code>.
            This method provides <emphasis>no</emphasis> benefits from a plain 
            <code>require_once('Zend/Controller/Front.php');</code> in these situations. 
            In fact, using it unnecessarily can have a significant impact on performance.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Basically, the point is to avoid using <classname>Zend_Loader</classname>
            in situations where a require/include would work better unless you 
            need its features. It was designed for you to benefit from these features,
            not be hindered by them.
