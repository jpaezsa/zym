    <para>
        The <code>Zym_Controller_Action_Abstract</code> class is an extension
        of Zend_Controller_Action. It adds get methods for the view object and 
        view prefix. It also provides a goto method to perform redirects.

    <para>
        The goto method provides a proxy to the redirector action helper. 
        It has basically the same interface as the redirector's goto method.
        The only difference is the added $exit boolean. This boolean decides if 
        the script should exit immediately after the redirect is issued.
